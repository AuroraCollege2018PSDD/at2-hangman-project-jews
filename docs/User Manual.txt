You are then asked to guess a letter from a-z and if you guess the letter wrong, a new part of the drawing will be added. 
Once the drawing is complete after a certain amount of attempts you lose.
If you guess a letter correct, the letter will show up where in the word it sits, and you will get to try again without parts of the drawing being added.
If you guess the entire word correct you win.

The user will then be asked if they would like to play another game.
